(* You can use any result from previous homeworks, exercises, or lectures without proof.*)

(* Exercise 1 *)

(* Define the universe of pointed types as follows. *)

Definition PtdUU := âˆ‘ T : UU, T.

(* Formulate and show univalence for the universe of pointed types. Use the univalence axiom ~univalenceAxiom~ from the library.*)

(* Exercise 2 *)

(* Define the type of groups. *)

(* Exercise 3 *)

(* Give a group structure on the booleans ~bool~ and show that that produces a term of the type of groups. Use the fact ~isasetbool~ that ~bool~ is a set.*)

(* Exercise 4 *)

(* Formalize a (simple) fact or construction about groups that you like. E.g., the fact that inverses are unique, or the definition of subgroup. *)
